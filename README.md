# Count Unique Names
A small python script which takes alot of three names and analyzes it and from the three names we get a number. 
The number of unique names.
### Installing
install the csv python library (usually is intalled with python).
```
pip install csv
```
Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/yoav-shaham/count_unique_names.git
```
If you have python in your path you can just run directly from cmd.
```
count_unique_names.py "billFirstName" "billLastName" "shipFirstName" "shipLastName" "billNameOnCard"
```

## Important to note
This script is relativly dynamic meaning it is easy to go inside and change values such as the prices and the threshhold for something to pass as a typo.
